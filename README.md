# MKY-FISH_scripts
ImageJ/Fiji macros, CellProfiler 3.0 pipeline and its parameters, and data and code for a ROC analysis used in the paper "Transcriptome response and spatial pattern of gene expression in the primate subventricular zone neurogenic niche after cerebral ischemia", Published in Front. Cell Dev. Biol. | doi: 10.3389/fcell.2020.584314 

The ImageJ/Fiji macros are provided as variants for single image processing following the structure of the workflow, and as macros for batch processing. Some of the batch processing macros use a template developed by porifera.net.
The R notebooks directory contains the data and the notebook with the ROC curve analysis used for the selection of thresholds for the classification of cells.
