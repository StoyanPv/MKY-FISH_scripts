# MKY-FISH_scripts
ImageJ/Fiji macros, CellProfiler 3.0 pipeline and its parameters and data and code for a ROC analysis used in the paper "Global transcriptomic analysis with high-throughput in situ hybridazion in monkey anterior subventricular zone after ischemia reveals novel markers of quiescent and activated neural progenitors in the adult primate brain"

The ImageJ/Fiji macros are given as variants for single image processing following the structure of the workflow, described in the Supplement document, and as macros for batch processing. Some of the batch processing macros use a template developed by porifera.net.
The R notebooks directory contains the data and the notebook with the ROC curve analysis used for the selection of thresholds for the classification of cells.
